# 🖼️ ImageToAscii

**ImageToAscii** is a simple Windows Forms app written in **C#** that converts `.jpeg` images into ASCII art saved as a `.txt` file. It maps image brightness to characters to recreate the image using only text.

## 🚀 Features

- Load `.jpeg` images
- Convert images to ASCII art
- Export ASCII output to a text file

## ⚠️ Note

Exception handling still needs improvement — use with care on unexpected input or file types.

## 🛠️ Tech

- C#
- Windows Forms (.NET)

## 🧪 Usage

1. Load a `.jpeg` file
2. Preview the image
3. Convert and save as `.txt`

## Future plans
- I am planning on recreating this with ASP.NET as a web app
